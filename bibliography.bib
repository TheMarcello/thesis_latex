  abstract = {The ATLAS collaboration at LHC has chosen the resistive Micromegas technology, along with the small-strip Thin Gap Chambers (sTGC), for the high luminosity upgrade of the first muon station in the high-rapidity region, the so called New Small Wheel (NSW) project. After the R&D, design and prototyping phase, the first series production Micromegas quadruplets have been constructed at all involved construction sites: in France, Germany, Italy, Russia and Greece. The achievement of the requirements for these detectors revealed to be even more challenging than expected when scaling from the small prototypes to the large dimensions. We describe the construction and relevant problems, to a large extent common to other micro-pattern gaseous detectors, and the adopted solutions. Final validation results on the achieved mechanical precision and on the stability during operation will be presented, along with the main results of the modules certification with cosmic rays. Additionally, one of the first series modules, equipped with a prototype of the final front-end electronics based on VMM chip, was tested in muon/pion beam at the H8 line of SPS at CERN during the summer of 2018. We present the test setup and performance results on efficiency and resolution for perpendicular and inclined tracks.}

  abstract = {While the on-going Run-3 data-taking campaign will provide twice the integrated proton–proton luminosity currently available at the LHC, most of the data expected for the full LHC physics program will only be delivered during the HL-LHC phase. For this, the LHC will undergo an ambitious upgrade program to be able to deliver an instantaneous luminosity of 7.5⋅1034cm−2s−1, allowing the collection of more than 3 ab−1 of data at s=13.6(14)TeV. This unprecedented data sample will allow the ATLAS experiment to perform several precision measurements to constrain the Standard Model (SM) in yet unexplored regions of phase space, in particular in the Higgs sector, only accessible at the LHC. To benefit from such a rich data sample, it is fundamental to upgrade the detector to cope with the challenging experimental conditions that include radiation doses 10 times higher than what ATLAS experienced since its construction and increase in the number of interactions per bunch crossing from the current 50-60 to 200. The upgrade of the ATLAS detector comprises a completely new all-silicon tracker with extended rapidity coverage that will replace the current inner tracker detector; a redesigned trigger and data acquisition system for the calorimeters and muon systems, allowing the implementation of a readout system that can operate complex trigger algorithms at 40 MHz. Finally, a new subsystem called High Granularity Timing Detector will aid the track-vertex association in the forward region by providing timing information to the reconstructed tracks. An important ingredient, relevant to almost all measurements, is the precise determination of the delivered luminosity with systematic uncertainties below the percent level. This challenging task will be achieved by collecting the information from several detector systems using different and complementary techniques. This document will describe the ongoing ATLAS detector upgrade status and the main results obtained with the prototypes, giving a synthetic view of the whole upgrade project.}

  abstract  = {The High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD) will be installed in the ATLAS detector to mitigate pile-up effects during the High Luminosity (HL) upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The design of the HGTD is based on the use of Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs), with an active thickness of 50 μm, that allow to measure with high-precision the time of arrival of particles. The HGTD will improve the particle-vertex assignment by measuring the track time with a resolution ranging from approximately 30 ps at the beginning of the HL-LHC operations to 50 ps at the end. Performances of several unirradiated, as well as neutron- and proton-irradiated, LGAD sensors from different vendors have been measured in beam test campaigns during the years 2018 and 2019 at CERN SPS and DESY. This paper presents the results obtained with data recorded by an oscilloscope synchronized with a beam telescope which provides particle position information within a resolution of a few μm. Collected charge, time resolution and hit efficiency are presented. In addition to these properties, the charge uniformity is also studied as a function of the position of the incident particle inside the sensor pad.}

  abstract  = {The evolution of particle detectors has always pushed the technological limit in order to provide enabling technologies to researchers in all fields of science. One archetypal example is the evolution of silicon detectors, from a system with a few channels 30 years ago, to the tens of millions of independent pixels currently used to track charged particles in all major particle physics experiments. Nowadays, silicon detectors are ubiquitous not only in research laboratories but in almost every high-tech apparatus, from portable phones to hospitals. In this contribution, we present a new direction in the evolution of silicon detectors for charge particle tracking, namely the inclusion of very accurate timing information. This enhancement of the present silicon detector paradigm is enabled by the inclusion of controlled low gain in the detector response, therefore increasing the detector output signal sufficiently to make timing measurement possible. After providing a short overview of the advantage of this new technology, we present the necessary conditions that need to be met for both sensor and readout electronics in order to achieve 4D tracking. In the last section, we present the experimental results, demonstrating the validity of our research path.}

The basic functions of radiation detector systems are described. Constraints in electro-mechanical integration are illustrated, such as minimizing material in tracking detectors, which in turn drives the need for low power dissipation to reduce material in cabling and cooling systems. The chapter then moves on to overviews of semiconductor sensor physics and signal formation, energy and position resolution, sensor structures including strip and pixel devices, signal acquisition electronics, electronic noise, signal processing, and digitization. The final section illustrates how individual sensor channels are combined to form detector modules and how the signal readout is organized in large systems.},
