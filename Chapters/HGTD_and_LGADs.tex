\section{The High Granularity Time Detector}\label{sec:HGTD}

As mentioned before in \nameref{subsec:high_luminosity_upgrade}, the HL-LHC will see an increase in the number of collisions per bunch\footref{footnote:particle_beam_bunches}, with heightened pile-up effects (when a collision happens very close to one or more other events, thus complicating track reconstruction.) 
 
A new way to mitigate this effect will be "\textit{to use high-precision timing information to distinguish between collisions occurring very close in space but well-separated in time}" \cite{CERN-LHCC-2020-007}. This is set to be accomplished by the High Granularity Time Detector (HGTD).

The detector will cover pseudrapidities between $2.4 < \eta < 4.0$ \footnote{the pseudorapity is $\eta=-\ln \tan(\theta/2)$ where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the $z$ axis, i.e. the beam direction.} (so an incident angle roughly between 2째 and 10째), complementing the ITk (Inner Tracker)\marginpar{\flushleft I need to talk about ITk and what it will be replacing \nameref{subsec:ATLAS_upgrades}} which has worse resolution in this forward region. %%% I could put plot with the simulation of z resolution vs \eta of ITk

\subsection{Detector layout}\label{subsec:HGTD_layout}

The detector consists of two thin disks with that will be placed outside the ITk , as shown in Figure \ref{fig:HGTD_location}. The detector is divided into three concentric active regions, as can be seen Figures \ref{fig:HGTD_location} and \ref{fig:pulseHeight_cut}, ranging: \qty{120}{\milli\meter} - \qty{230}{\milli\meter}, \qty{230}{\milli\meter} - \qty{470}{\milli\meter} and  \qty{470}{\milli\meter} - \qty{640}{\milli\meter} \cite{CERN-LHCC-2020-007}. Beyond the last region aret the peripheral electronics. The two disks are covered by 8032 modules in total, each module containing two silicon sensors and two ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). Each sensor features 15x15 pads of Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs, discussed in the next Chapter \ref{chap:LGADs}).

The radiation that the components will withstand depends strongly on the radius. Due to electronics and sensors specifications, a minimum charge of \qty{4}{\femto\coulomb} is required. This is achievable up to radiation damage of \qty{2.5e15}{\neutroneq\centi\meter^{-2}}\footnote{The radiation damage equivalent to neutrons at \qty{1}{\mega\electronvolt} }; as a result, the sensor and electronics within the smallest ring will be replaced after each \qty{1000}{\femto\barn^{-1}} and the ones within the middle ring will be replaced at half of the data-taking (\qty{20000}{\femto\barn^{-1}}). 

% The luminous region in the nominal scenario for Run 3 will see a Gaussian spread of approximately 50mm along the $z$ axis and a width of 175$\si{ps}$ in time %(Figure \ref{fig:events_pileup}).

HGTD will provide time information of charged particles with a time resolution of 30ps (up to 50ps at the end of life) which will greatly improve the reconstruction of the primary vertex of collision.

\section{Working principles of silicon sensors}

The core of a silicon sensor consists of a junction between two differently doped layers, which means that small concentrations of impurities with either higher atomic number ($n$-type) or lower ($p$-type) are introduced inside the crystals.
This forms a $pn$-junction and when a voltage is applied with positive potential on the $n$-side and negative on the $p$-side (reverse bias) the volume between the two layers is depleted of mobile charges and becomes an insulator with an internal electric field.

When a charged particle traverses this depletion layer it frees up electron-hole pairs, which move to the electrodes and can be measured. 

\section{Low Gain Avalanche Detectors}

A particular type of silicon sensors are Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGAD), an example is shown is shown in Figure \ref{fig:LGADs_schema}. The major innovation is an additional $p$-type layer below the $n+$ electrode, this creates a high electric field region which leads to an avalanche effect\footnote[2]{When electrons acquire enough energy they can create new electron-hole pairs ('impact ionization'), which can themselves create new pairs and initialize a multiplication chain that leads to an enhanced signal} of the electrons. This effect produces a gain of around $~10$ \marginpar{\flushleft source}
